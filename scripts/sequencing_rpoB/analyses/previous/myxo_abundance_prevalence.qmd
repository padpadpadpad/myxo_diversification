# Exploring the abundance and diversity of Myxococcus ASVs

## Outline

Here we want to look at the abundance and prevalence of Myxococcus ASVs from the rpoB sequencing.

## Load in packages

```{r load_packages}
# load in packages
library(phyloseq)

```

## Load in data and filter for only Myxococcus

The phyloseq run for the rpoB sequencing returns a huge phyloseq object, which we want to filter for only ASVs assigned to be in phyla assigned to Myxococcota (for the GTDB database that is **Myxococcota**, **Myxococcota_A**, **Myxococcota_B**). We will load in the
